An Overview of COVID-19 {data-orientation=rows}
======================================================


```{r setup_1, include=FALSE}

Rows {data-height=350}

### **Main objective**

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Our task is to investigate data related to COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, and examine the mortality of COVID-19 in relation to socioeconomic factors. 

**Ratio of Case Types to the Population in 2021**

### **Data Source**

Data was retrieved from Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 API and the World Bank API.

```


Socioeconomic Factors {data-orientation=rows}
==================================================

We chose to evaluate the spread of COVID-19 in relation to a select number of socioeconomic factors. After preliminary analysis we chose Healthcare Expenditure as % of GDP as the most impactful 
metric in helping assess covid mortality and case-count data.   

**Table 1:** Socioeconomic factors.

|Socioeconomic Factor|Measure|Categories|
  |:---:|:---------------:|:--------------:|
  |Education|Literacy Rate in females above 15 yrs| <= 0.5: Extremely low <br> <= 3.9:Low <br> <= 6.5: Moderate <br> <= 11.9:High <br> > 11.9:Very high|
  |Income Level|Income in Dollars|Low income, Lower middle income, Upper middle income, High income|
  |Population Density|Population per square kilometer| <= 100: Extremely low <br> <= 250: Low <br> <= 500: Moderate <br> > 500: High|
  |Health|% of GDP| <= 1.5: Extremely low <br> <= 4.3: Low <br> <= 6.1: Moderate <br> <= 8.0: High <br> > 8.0: Very high|
  |Region|Geographical area|East Asia and Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, Latin America & the Caribbean, Middle East and North Africa, North America, South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa|
  |Income inequality|GINI Index|< 0.2 represents perfect income equality <br> 0.2–0.3: relative equality <br> 0.3–0.4: adequate equality <br> 0.4–0.5: big income gap <br>  above 0.5: severe income gap|

### Boxplot Analysis of Mortality 

```{r boxplot_death, echo = FALSE}
#Reading in newly-constructed datafile on health-expenditure in different countries, can see data used in Task4.R File  
health_exp_deaths <- readRDS("df_health_expenditure_deaths.RDS")

#Created a new column called Deaths per 100000 
health_exp_deaths$`Deaths per 100000` <- health_exp_deaths$deaths_per_capita * 100000

#Filtered out rows with NA-values for the health-expenditure category
health_exp_deaths <- health_exp_deaths %>%
  filter(!is.na(health_exp_deaths$df_health_conf_categories))

#Creating boxplot for number of deaths per 100 000 based on health-expenditure category type 
box_1 <- ggplot(health_exp_deaths, aes(x = df_health_conf_categories, y = `Deaths per 100000`, fill = df_health_conf_categories)) +  geom_bar(stat = "identity", na.rm=T) + scale_fill_manual(values = wes_palette("Zissou1")) + labs(y="Deaths per 100000",
       x="Healthcare Expenditure by % of GDP",   
       title="COVID mortality rate and Healthcare expenditure by % of GDP") +
  theme(legend.position="none")

box_1

```
**_NOTE:_** The ANOVA test found there was a significant difference between these categories in impacting COVID mortality. The post-hoc Tukey test found significant differences for High-Low, Very high-Low and High-Moderate health expenditure categories. 


```{r anova_mortality_health, include=FALSE}
#Performing ANOVA and Post-Hoc Tukey Test for Covid Mortality Data 
one.way_mort <- aov(health_exp_deaths$deaths_per_capita ~ health_exp_deaths$df_health_conf_categories, data = health_exp_deaths)
