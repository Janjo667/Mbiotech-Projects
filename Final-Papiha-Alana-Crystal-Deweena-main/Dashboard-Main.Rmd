### **Main objective**

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Our task is to investigate data related to COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, and examine the mortality of COVID-19 in relation to socioeconomic factors. 

**Ratio of Case Types to the Population in 2021** 
```{r ratios}
library("wbstats")
library(httr)
library(stringr)
library(tidyr)
library(jsonlite)
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(plyr)
library(zoo)

pops2021 <- as.data.frame(wb_data("SP.POP.TOTL", country = "all", start_date = 2021, end_date = 2021))

#Filtering out or removing values with digits in iso2c column, along with NA values
pops2021_2 <- filter(pops2021, !grepl("[0-9]", iso2c)) 
pops2021_2 <- pops2021_2[!is.na(pops2021_2$iso2c),]
pops2021_2 <- pops2021_2 %>% drop_na(iso2c)

#Removing columns from country-column that have select labels
pops2021_2 <- filter(pops2021_2, !grepl("countries", country)) 
pops2021_2 <- filter(pops2021_2, !grepl("only", country)) 
pops2021_2 <- filter(pops2021_2, !grepl("income", country)) 
pops2021_2 <- filter(pops2021_2, !grepl("total", country)) 
pops2021_2 <- filter(pops2021_2, !grepl("blend", country)) 
pops2021_2 <- filter(pops2021_2, !grepl("Union", country))
pops2021_2 <- filter(pops2021_2, !grepl("&", country))
pops2021_2 <- filter(pops2021_2, !grepl("area", country))  
pops2021_2 <- filter(pops2021_2, !grepl("members", country))  
pops2021_2 <- filter(pops2021_2, !grepl("North America", country))  
pops2021_2 <- filter(pops2021_2, !grepl("Sub", country))  
pops2021_2 <- filter(pops2021_2, !grepl("Union", country))  

#Taking sum of population for all countries to get global world population
world_pop <- sum(as.numeric(pops2021$SP.POP.TOTL), na.rm = T)


#Copying code from Task 1, afterwards import to RDS object to obtain confirmed, deaths and recovered 
res <- VERB("GET", url = "https://covid19-stats-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/cases?")

#cat(content(res, 'text'))

totalconfirmed_cases <- content(res)$confirmed
totalconfirmed_deaths <- content(res)$deaths
totalconfirmed_recovered <- content(res)$recovered

ratios <- matrix(c((world_pop/totalconfirmed_cases), (world_pop/totalconfirmed_deaths), (world_pop/totalconfirmed_recovered)))
colnames(ratios) <- c('Number cases over population')
rownames(ratios) <- c('Cases', 'Deaths','Recovered')
ratios <- as.table(ratios)
ratios
```

### **Data Source**

Data was retrieved from Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 API and the World Bank API.

### **World Bank API data**
```{r, fig.cap="This data was last updated July 20, 2022 <br> NYP.GDP.MKTP.CD - indicator of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in current USD                                                                   <br> iso2c - 2 digit country code                                      <br> iso3c - 3 digit country code"}
df <- wb_data(
  country = "all",
  indicator = "NY.GDP.MKTP.CD")
df <- df %>% select(-unit,-obs_status,-footnote,-last_updated)

# Socioeconomic Factors 

We chose to evaluate the spread of COVID-19 in relation to a select number of socioeconomic factors. 

**Table 1:** Socioeconomic factors.

|Socioeconomic Factor|Measure|Categories|
  |:---:|:---------------:|:--------------:|
  |Education|Literacy Rate in females above 15 yrs| <= 0.5: Extremely low <br> <= 3.9:Low <br> <= 6.5: Moderate <br> <= 11.9:High <br> > 11.9:Very high|
  |Income Level|Income in Dollars|Low income, Lower middle income, Upper middle income, High income|
  |Population Density|Population per square kilometer| <= 100: Extremely low <br> <= 250: Low <br> <= 500: Moderate <br> > 500: High|
  |Health|% of GDP| <= 1.5: Extremely low <br> <= 4.3: Low <br> <= 6.1: Moderate <br> <= 8.0: High <br> > 8.0: Very high|
  |Region|Geographical area|East Asia and Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, Latin America & the Caribbean, Middle East and North Africa, North America, South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa|
  |Income inequality|GINI Index|< 0.2 represents perfect income equality <br> 0.2–0.3: relative equality <br> 0.3–0.4: adequate equality <br> 0.4–0.5: big income gap <br>  above 0.5: severe income gap|
